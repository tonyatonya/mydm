	                <p>We aim to deliver all orders as confirmed but there is a very minor possibility of stocks running out if several orders are placed at the same time. This situation is highly unusual. If this happens, our customer service will contact the customer.</p>

	                <p>Sometimes when you order more than one item, they are not all shipped at the same time. This is because some products are stocked later. If you ordered an item that was not in stock at that moment, it will be shipped the moment it comes back in stock. If you have any more questions about your order, please send an e-mail to Customer service and Include your order number in your e-mail so that we can answer your question as quickly as possible.
