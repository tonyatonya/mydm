	                <p>Sometimes when you order more than one item, they are not all shipped at the same time. This is because some products are stocked later. If you ordered an item that was not in stock at that moment, it will be shipped the moment it comes back in stock. If you have any more questions about your order, please send an e-mail to Customer service and Include your order number in your e-mail so that we can answer your question as quickly as possible.
